# K-meansToy

K-means 1.0...

There are many bugs now...

## Tutorial

Hey Guys! Next I will teach you how to use my K-meansToy!

### Input
![avatar](/Photo/InputEx.png)

As you can see 
We can input as follows

> 10 2 3 100
> 
> 1 1
> 
> 2 2
> 
> 3 3
> 
> 10 10
> 
> 11 11
> 
> 12 12
> 
> 50 50
> 
> 51 51
> 
> 52 52
> 
> 53 53

And in fist line 

10 means that there is 10 points to input

2 means that every point has 2 values

3 means that our program will divide the points into 3 clusters

and the last parameter means that the program will iterate up to 100

and then 10 lines means 10 points

### Output

Okï¼ŒBoys! I think output is easy to understand.

The program Output 3 cluster and its ID and its points member which also contains id and values. And it also output Central point of each cluster.
